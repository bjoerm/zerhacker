[splitter]
min_pixel_ratio = 0.10    # Minimum ratio of height/width of the scanned image that any contour must reach. Else the contour will be omitted. Use higher values if the ratio of the picture to the scanned album page is high and lower values otherwise.
detection_threshold = 150 # The lower the less contours are detected. Note that this parameter refers to THRESH_BINARY_INV. Can be set between 0 and 255. https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html


[fine_cut]
detection_threshold_finecut = 200 # Threshold value: Higher values represent less aggressive contour search. If it's chosen too high, a white border will be introduced.
extra_crop = 10                   # Extra crop: After crop/rotate often a small white border remains. This removes this. If it cuts off too much of your image, adjust this.
